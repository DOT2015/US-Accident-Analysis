Currently, there are about 3 million accident records in this dataset. Check here to learn more about this dataset.

## Insights from the Dataset Analysed:
 
- Less than 5% cities has accidents above 1000
- 95% of the cities has accidents below 1000
- from the graph above and exploration it shows that in 1306 Cities only reported one accident which sinces odd and needs to be investigated
- Most of the accident happens between 5 - 10 and the obvious reason is the people are in a rust to work, schools and their businesses
- after the time started above the accident rate goes down, until 15 - 18 hours when people are going back home from work, school and businesses
- Accident occurs more during the week days and is less during weekends when people dont mostly go out.
- More Accidents occurs during the 10 -12 month and i think that is the time that people are trying to bring different activities to a close, in a way they try to do many things at the same time
